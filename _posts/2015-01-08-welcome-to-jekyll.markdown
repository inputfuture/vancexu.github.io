[Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects][LHTL] 是 University of California, San Diego 在[coursera][coursera]上开放的一门公开课，

> Whether you are an outstanding or a struggling student, "Learning How to Learn" will give you powerful mental tools that will help you learn more effectively in tough-to-master subjects. You will discover practical, immediately useful insights that will help you to more deeply master your studies.

我在完成这门4周的课程之后受益匪浅，对习以为常的一些方法和观点有了更深层的认识，比如解释我们为什么会拖延简直是一个巴掌过来就给我震醒了；同时也欣喜掌握了一些新的理念和方法，比如focus and diffused两种学习模式，chunks的科学理念。总之，该课让我更会学习了。在这里分两部分记录我学到的主要内容，既是方便我复习，也希望能为大家节省上课的时间。我们的目标只有一个：**了解大脑的工作原理，以便更好的学习。**

## Week1: Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

我们可以简化的认为

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
