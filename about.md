This is Bowei XU (vancexu). Welcome to my personal blog :)

I am now a Software Development Engineer at Expedia.Inc. On Dec 2014, I got my CS master degree at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree at Nanjing University, major in Software Engineering. 

I am an active learner, love coding, taking open courses and reading. Always interested in Mobile & Web Technologies, Big Data and Startups. In my spare time, I also enjoy singing songs, playing volleyball, doing workout, hiking...

This blog will be used to share my knowledge on Computer Science, Self Improvement, Phychology etc. I hope the blog can help me better understand what I learned, make contributions to readers personal growth, and make new friends. The blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
